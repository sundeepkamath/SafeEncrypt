# SafeEncrypt

SafeEncrypt is a utility to encrypt files. 
These days we save a lot of documents on the cloud and sync those on multiple devices. If you have some important documents for which you have privacy concerns and don't entirely trust the cloud service providers or wish to be a little extra careful then this utility is for you.
